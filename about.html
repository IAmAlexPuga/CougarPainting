                        he enjoys winding down with weekly movie nights, favoring the adrenaline 
                        rush of action films. Juan has been at the helm of our company

                    <p class="fontDescription">Meet Alex, a versatile member of our team. Alex holds 
                        a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from WSU and currently serves 
                        as our software engineer and project manager. With a strong 
                        background in technology and a passion for innovative solutions, he plays a 
                        pivotal role in steering our projects toward success. When not immersed in 
                        the world of software, Alex enjoys his downtime, tending to his Traeger grill 
                         to create delectable smoked dishes. Alex's multifaceted 
                         interests, from technology to culinary delights and his affection for 
                         animals, make him a valuable and well-rounded team member.

                    <p class="fontDescription">Meet Roman, a dedicated member of our team. 
                        With six years of experience as a professional landscaper and painter, 
                        Roman's passion for transforming outdoor and indoor spaces shines through 
                        his work. Although he excels in both, Roman's true love is painting, where 
                        he brings artistic flair and meticulous attention to detail. Beyond his 
                        career, Roman aspires to fulfill his dream job of becoming a coach, 
                        inspiring and mentoring others to achieve their goals. Recently stepping 
                        into the world of fatherhood, he is as committed to his family as he is 
                        to his craft, embodying the qualities of hard work and devotion in all 
                        aspects of life.
